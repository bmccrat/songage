Falafels For Brains: Deep Fried
Written originally on guitar, chord strumming simple, let it ring

          Dm
they say "dont look out the window"
          Em
they say "what youre seeing isnt there"
          C
they say "everything is rotten"
             G
but if thats so let us decay

     Dm
they say that there will be nothing left
       Em
by the time we hit 50
         C                       G
they say everything will be gone soon

     Dm
they say that this is the reason 
               Em
for all of the abuse
              C
but its not a matter of black and white
    G
its grey

  Dm
i think that if everyone was a nihilist
                 Em
there would be a lot less love and mystery
  C
i think that if everyone was a fatalist
       G
then a long long time ago we woulda been dead

             Dm
so if theres nothing left to look forward to
       Em
then i have to make something up
       C
and if this is the end of all i knew
            G
then we are finally enough

        Dm
i got a clover in my backpack
  Em
i picked it for you in rehab
      C
there wasnt much else to do than
    G                     G
sit around and believe in miracles

      Dm
so we told stories of every time
                Em
that we shoulda died
    C                       G
and somehow it helped us to dream

   Dm                            Em
we told stories of every time we told a lie
       C
and we called it
       G
coming clean

       Dm
so its not for lack of trying 
       Em
that i find myself alone
        C               C
and its not for lack of loving
       G
that i still dont feel at home

    Dm
its not for lack of motivation
     Em
that i dont get shit done
  C
i fried my brain from
G               G
here to kingdom come
  C
i fried my brain from
G               G
here to kingdom come

   Dm
so if youll listen when
    Em
the saints come marching in
       C
i will hold your hand
   G              G
as we confess our sins

         Dm
and well scare them all away
                  Em
they cant believe half the shit we say
     C
oh i fried my brain
     G
from here to kingdom come
      C
yes i fried my brain
     G               G
from here to kingdom come
