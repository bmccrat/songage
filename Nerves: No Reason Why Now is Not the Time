Nerves: No Reason Why Now is Not the Time- 1/27/20
Written as spoken word poem, played with the chords A7, EM, C, G interspersed as the player feels
they fit. Some words omitted for flow when its played as a song. All words complete as spoken word.

kids just coming to age enough where theyre so painfully self aware
i can see them squirm under skin maked over by thin paper mache layers
convincing themselves that they have the right to take up the space that theyre in

observation waiting like
deer communicating
i hear what your eyes are saying
when your words do not

lingering between
wracking my brain with questions like
why are you here? 
do you harbor any fear?
how badly does this scare you on a scale of one to ten?

making friends, god how can anybody do that they ask
well watch long enough 
and you will learn, that no one knows what theyre doing!
growth is a shining inside badge of 
confidence you earn

like when will the stars align
and when will i meet the love of my life
and when the opportunity comes
will i watch her walk by?

or say hello ive been watching you
and as weird as it may sound its true
that your beautry radiated through
the plexiglass between us at the indian buffet
in a way thats just as stunning as you stand before me today

but hey 
maybe that sounds better on paper 
and when i say it out loud
ill say it with the wrong inflection
and freak you the fuck out

but hey ill shoot my shot
if youll hold yours
and hope you draw and aim
because at the end of the day when we stand at the line
you could be thinking the samee

but hey 
if i keep to myself im invincible
you know except for the war i wage inside  my mind
and i have a thousand excuses to watch life at a distance
and none of them make it possible
to let you pass by

so hey
maybe you like coffee 
but you look like you prefer tea
and i am a master at brewing a cup and letting it sit too long
so maybe if you drink it with me ill finally finish one

yes thats how im asking you out
and i hope you can read between lines
because it takes alot for me to follow through
seventy five percent of the time

but i would take a bus to see you
and stand on a metro platform at rush hour
if it meant that i had one good reason 
to actually take a shower this week

i know, good pick up line
and i know im a rare find
but a gem in the rough
once you wash off the dirt
is infinitely more satisfying

than trying to make something work
between two people who already think
they know who they are

so when i watch 
im not looking for anything
and when i see something i like
i dont expect to have it

other than to bear my soul for all its worth
when the time is right
and if the time is always wrong
i know when to pick a fight

and im a pacifist when it comes to interactions
but that doesnt mean ill wait my whole life
for love to all into my lap

and i will stand
when i have something to stand for
and i will take what i need
and not a penny more
because i know now
what i did not ever before
that everyone is subconciously waiting
for fate to walk through their door

what if i told you 
that you must seek to find
and what if the human race
doesnt run half as fast
as the way it does in your mind.
