Childs Dreams- 5/15/19 
Written by Nicholas M. and I, again Live At BRC- Played originally with nicky on guitar and me on 
vocals. The whole song is a repitition of the chord progression.

   F                    C
we tramped in woods and hung from branches
G                    C
climbed trees taking risky chances
G            C
when we were young x2

   F                  C
we learned to love a million faces
 G             C
traveled to so many places
G            C
when we were young x2


we rolled in grass and ate mud pies

stared out of rose colored eyes

when we were young x2


way down in the garden grove 

so many stories were told

when i was young x2


id roll around dirtying clothes

digging deep sandbox holes

when i was young x2



the eyes i had were innocent

no sorrows and no regrets

when i was young x2


we jumped over the lava floors

stuffed towels under bathroom doors

when we were young x2


watching clouds pass through the sky

never knew i could get so high

when i was young

till i grew up


play guitar with a friend or two

drunk on beer i stole from you

when i was young x2


mother said to her only son

youre playing with a loaded gun

but i was growing up x2


started smoking ciggarettes

gas station ash trays second bests

when i was young x2


years go by waking up in feilds

i cant express how i truly feel

is this growing up? x2


sent me away after 18

you sold your babies drunken dreams

i was still young x2


the time was right the place was wrong

we both realized we didnt belong

we sang our song x2


time passed but we found eachother

can my best friend be my lover

years go by x2


the night was clear we were alone

do you wanna make a house a home

while were still young? x2


do you wanna hold my hand 

and settle on my fathers land

till we grow old x2


examples set by mom and dad

ill give my child the life i had

till i grow old x2
