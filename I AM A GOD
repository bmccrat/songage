I AM A GOD- 2/28/15 INSTRUMENT: PIANO This song is played by a consistent flourish of the fingers
through the chords as they go along with building up of volume as it comes to the ending
crascendo.

Em                                Dm
this one, is to the songs with no music
G                Am
to the ones, who survived the winter months

Em             Dm
i grow hungry, when im alone
G               Am
with nothing, to satiate me

Em             Dm
i am a god, oh yes im a goooood
        G              Am
oh im a goood, fearin woman

Em                          Dm
i give you sunlight, in the daytime
                      G                   Am
and oh i give you the moon, the moon at night

     Em               Dm              G 
bury me, in a shallow grave, in the middle,
              Am
of wherewolf country

           Em                Dm
oh you see only, half in the daytime
            G                          Am
and by the niiiiight, youre completely blind

      Em                       Dm
like drinking, from a poisoned well
           G                    Am
nobody but youuu baby, can save yourself


i am a god oh yes im a goooood

oh im a goood fearin woman

i am a god oh yes im a goooood

oh im a goood fearin woman
