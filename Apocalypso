Apocalypso (Whatre You Gonna Do When You Cant Run)- 4/4/20
Written on guitar, chords ringing at first and then chunking and ringing combination towards the 
chorus with full ringing on the outro.

E
in a new world
                   A
will we be able to tell the difference
        D
between living what is true
             A
and living a lie

     E
in a new world 
            A
will we see whats been taken
           D
or will it still be
              A
an eye for an eye

        E
focused action
            A
waiting for something to happen
         D
ive been waiting for this moment
         A
my whole life

    E   
hypochondriacs are so fucking excited
        A
finally theyve got
          D
something real
               A
to worry their minds

E
what are we gonna do
         A
when the foundations crumbled
       D
around us and
A
nothing will be the same

        E
will we wish for times to be
        A
exactly how they used to
           D
or will we start to play
            A
a brand new game

     E
weve all been waiting
        A
oh weve all been praying
       D                    A
oh we all have something to say
     E
weve all been listening 
         A
and weve all been wonderiing
      D
and i think for once
                A
we are actually thinking the same

     E
weve seen destruction
    A
and weve seen mass distraction
         D
and weve seen how the 
            A
combination kills

        E
we will know mobilization
    A      
revolutions pulse runs deeper
         D
than any government funded
                    A
oil rig can fucking drill!

     E
were timeless and in time
A
inside the outisdes
           D
we have survived a million
          A
judgement days

     E
weve prepared for retribution
     A
weve prepared for a solution
        D
and yet nobody is
   A             A
ready to fucking change!

E
what is there to resist 
                A
when the worlds nature is chaos
                 D
what is there to fight 
            A
if nothings left

      E
wiped clean by a plague
                 A
spearheading the proletariat uprising
         D
there is nothing like new life
         A
to honor death

   E
weve all been waiting
        A
oh weve all been praying
       D                    A
oh we all have something to say
     E
weve all been listening 
         A
and weve all been wonderiing
      D
and i think for once
                A
we are actually thinking the same


E
watch now watch now
A
watch it all burn down
     D              A
like ashes on cheap cigarettes

E
come down low down
A
everybody slow down
D
fate is catching up
        A
with us again
