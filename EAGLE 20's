EAGLE 20's 5/10/19 Originally writtten on mandolin
Tempo gentle ringing chords picking up with pluckiness and palm muting as the verses pick up,
back to ringing chords in the chorous refrain.

Em
silently wailing
    Dm
the quiet is deafening
C
waves of marble 
G
lapping stone to stone

Em
break free into the wind
    Dm
and take the sorrows from my throat
    C
its gone before
    G
the story was ever told

Em
colluseums
   Dm
to memorialize
    C
how quickly we can fall 
          G
in such a short amount of time

______________________________
C
dont wander
        G                   C
without my memory
            F
we were the same            H
C
children playing a game
                            O
C
dont leave me 
       G                    R
before i
               F
have something beautiful    U
   C
to remember you by          S

Em
told your stories
Dm
thousands of times
   C
it wasnt my place to care
   G
if what you told were lies

Em
like a brother
       Dm
or was it really that way
   C
it doesnt matter now
  G
i dont think we'll see

Em
im under the impression
            Dm
while youre under the influence
        C
i never told you
         G
what you mean to me

Em
busted laces on your shoes
         Dm
walked a thousand miles
         C
probably walk a thousand more
            G
while youre out there getting high

Em
smoked too many ciggarettes 
     Dm
cant blame that on you
     C
your epiphany aint happened yet
      G
and i cant make it true

Em
i would give you all the spirit
         Dm
that ive come to know
    C
but none of it means a goddamn thing
         G
if youre not ready to grow
