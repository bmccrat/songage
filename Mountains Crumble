Mountains crumble- untitled- 3/12/20
Written on guitar originally, hammer ons throughout letting chords ring

       F7
bodies revealed
               Am
when snowbanks melt
      G
under layers of dirt and ash and water
        Am
they are waiting

           F7
intentions concealed
          Am
where the light of certainty

doesnt shine
G        Am
they are grinning

     F7
possibilities unmasstered
  Am
existential bastard
       G
we are all under used
        Am
and overplayed

F7
mixed into entropy
Am
spirits waver
G
ostensibly 
Am
fleeting

     F7
onyx dreams
        Am
sinking quickly into water
  G
a treasured paradox
  Am
illusory

    F7
the goal at the end 
         Am
seems to be have no goals left
G
fingers on dollar novels
         Am
flipping gingerly

  F7
wait in between meals
    Am
and steel mills
     G
that employ
            Am
all of your families

       F7
are we bound
          Am
or are we mistaken
                 G
souls running in circles
        Am
chasing ourselves
