Runaway- 5/23?/19
Originally composed on mandolin with ringing and chunking of the second strum for each chord.

       Bm                 Em
i have burnt down all the curches
    C                      G
and wonder where ill go to pray
Bm                Em
travelling out to philly 
        C              G
with no idea where ill stay

     Bm            Em
like hopping a locomotive
    C           G
not caring what train
      Bm            Em
doing anything and everything
            C             G
to get the fuck out of my brain

      Bm           Em
now i cant feel my face
        C                   G
but the wheels they keep on rolling
      Bm       Em
miles passing underneath
        C                  G
i still dont know where im going

    Bm             Em 
and just because i knew god
       C                G
doesnt mean that she is showing me the way
Bm Em
my eyes are closed
      C           G
dead ashes embers glowing

      Bm           Em
i put water on the fire
    C                G
now just to feel the steam
Bm                   Em
share my heart with crowds of people
       C                G
hoping they know what i mean

       Bm          Em
and my heart it is heavy
     C                            G
mind burdened with the things ive seen
    Bm                     Em
put myself through hell to heaven
       C              G
now im stuck right in between

       Bm            Em
if you showed me the way out
       C               G
i dont know if i would take it
          Bm          Em
my minds clouded by obsession
          C                 G
so i cant hear my own heart breaking

        Bm            Em
got so comfortable in sorrow
     C             G
that its become my home
        Bm         Em
so when im too far away
       C           G
my ego tells me im alone

       Bm            Em
and if im alone with myself
    C                  G
ill convince me that i know 
         Bm      Em
but dont make no mistake momma
       C           G
i aint got no self control


      Bm           Em
i put water on the fire
    C                G
now just to feel the steam
Bm                   Em
share my heart with crowds of people
       C                G
hoping they know what i mean


      Bm           Em
i put water on the fire
    C                G
now just to feel the steam
Bm                   Em
share my heart with Anybody
       C                G
hoping they know what i mean
