Shadoworkingonit-  4/9/20
This song is written on guitar and meant to be strummed gently with fingerpick flourishes letting
the chords ring out dramatically in between lines. CAPO 2

     Dm
i am inseparable from my shadow
        E
i am an accumulation of all 
    Am
the harm and pleasure
       G
i have ever inflicted

     Dm
i am not without wounds and scars
           E
and if the feeling of them
                   Am
running under your hands in the dark
                          G
leads you to leave i will let you

    Dm
our souls met in emblazoned light
   E
so bright you failed to see
    Am
the looming darkness you fear in yourself
       G
that i carry everywhere with me

            Dm
so when you see it what is your instinct
   E
to witness and honor or flee?
       Am
when i put up with your paradoxical brain
         G
will you attempt to understand me?

     Dm
your spirit is too immature
   E
to show up to me fully
         Am
and if i parcel out pieces of myself to you
          G
im hiding in semantic alleyways

       Dm
if the darkness that defines my light
       E
is cut crudely from the picture
  Am
i render myself living in
G
half truths for you

  Dm
never again will i compromise
       E
parts hidden in myself
       Am
surely i will lose everything
     G
if i do


POSSIBLE CHOR/OUTRO
         C
you were always free child
     G
even with the weight of the past
  Am                E
shackled around you ankles

                C
you were always eternal my daughter
     G              Am
even when the world resigned you
   Am          E
to lost in the inferno
