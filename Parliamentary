Written on piano, dramatic sustain to play and holding notes and blending them together.

        Cm
is it a ciggarette i want
          Bm
or just a moment and a half
   A                         E
to think about the company i keep

   Cm   
i feel like william burroughs
Bm
pen and paper in hand
        A
candle burning
                      E
as i nod in dreamless sleep

Gm
flaws in the charachter
    Eb
and plot holes
               B        F
make the story weak

Gm                 Eb
knowing silence is unsettling
           B
thats why babies
                  F
sing before they speak

    Cm
the chorous of a million songs
     Bm
that never found their notes
A                      E
resonate forgotten melodies

    Cm
for every over stuffed artist
           Bm
that never got the chance to starve
    A                           E
and space cadets with no air to breathe

Gm
flaws in the charachter
    Eb
and plot holes
               B        F
make the story weak

Gm                 Eb
knowing silence is unsettling
           B
thats why babies
                  F
sing before they speak

    Gm                      Eb
the moral at the end of the story
   B              F 
is what makes you believe
  Gm                    Eb                 
i would simply read the news
      B               F
if i wanted to feel tradgedy on tradgedy
