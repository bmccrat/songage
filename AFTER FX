AFTER FX - 5/10/19
Played originally on mandolin the chords ring the whole time in a longing sorrowful style

    F               Am
for so long ive been hiding out
    F                 Em
becoming anybody but myself

        F              Am
losing touch with what counts
      F                    Em
i was drifting further and further out

   F                            Em
is this what you thought it would be like   C
  F             Em   Am
cold ships in a dark night                  H 

      F                    Em               O
i can only hope i see your face again 
            F       Em      Am              R
and it will be like we imagined

    F                     Am
you waited for me to come down
      F               Em
crept down the stairs after i had run out

        F                    Am
we said love conquers all my darling
        F                           Em
but how you looked at me has got me wondering

  F             Em   Am
cold ships in a dark night                  H 

      F                    Em               O
i can only hope i see your face again 
            F       Em      Am              R
and it will be like we imagined
