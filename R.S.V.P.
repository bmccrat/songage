R.S.V.P.- 12/25/19

Composed on piano, translates well to mandolin, and guitar in that order. Played with simple up down
strumming letting the chords ring.

           D                              G               Bm

  D                 G         Bm

   A                                       G
or shave my head like this is some kind of bad breakup

  D            G                     Bm
i remember the priest scrambling for answers
             A                          G
when i was a kid asking questions about suicide
           D           G              Bm  
but theres noone thats quite a harder sell
        A                                    G
than an eight year old whos made up her mind that she wants to die

   D           G           Bm

   A                     G

D               G                 Bm            A                 G
religion is the type who wants to fuck without looking you in the eyes

  D             G                        Bm

           A                             G
or if your reaper looked black and empty just like mine

   D           G              Bm

    A              G

    Bm                  A              G

  D             G                        Bm

           A                             G
