MAYBE THIS TIME - 9/5/19
Composed on piano, in between the chords i have the notation written to "jazz down" which basically 
means sweep the chords down in line of the keys to the next chord in the progression if that
makes any sense. Listening to the recording will help with deciphering that instruction.

i wanted
           A
this to be poetry
       F
but it ended up
        D
being a lie

     D

   A   
to give up the fight
  F
