Played on guitar, fingerpicking and strumming letting it ring dramatically

Dm
mark me
            Am
ill be your canvas
     Em             Am
when you run out of space

Dm
turn me inside out 
           Am
flip every page
     Em                                 Am
just promise me that you wont lose your placee

    Dm
the ink will never run dry
             Am
just like my eyes
        Em
you can twist and contort me
           Am
im just an image in your mind

       Dm
theres no wrong note
             Am
when all the world knows is silence
  Em
i cant give you a reason
        Am
for god beating you senseless

       Dm
theres no wrong note
             Am
when all the world knows is silence
  Em
i cant give you a reason
        Am
for god being so careless

       Dm
theres dark times baby
           Am
and theres darker times
Em
comparatively
     Am
were doing well

       Dm
theres no wrong time
          Am
when the clock doesnt stop ticking
           Em                Am
and theres nobody waiting in line

       Dm
i will hold you when youre empty
       Am
i will see you when youre full
           Em
and i will give you everything ive got
          Am
and not a penny more

    Dm
its in your eyes the things youve seen
     Am
that keep you up at night
           Em
but i dont mind
                 Am
it happens to me too sometimes

    Dm
ill sleep with you when youre tossing
    Am
and turning in your head 
        Em
and ill hold your body down
            Am
so you dont rise from the bed

       Dm
theres no wrong note
             Am
when all the world knows is silence
  Em                             Am
i cant give you a reason for god beating you senseless

       Dm
theres no wrong note when the
Am
world is an orchestra
   Em
of sticks and stones
           Am
and theres no wrong words to say
