  B
giving up
                C
seems like the hardest thing to do
                Gm
but ive been practicing
          Eb            B
ive been practicing for you

  B
youre going to look at me
           C
with those eyes
                Gm
youre going to look too deep
    Eb            B
and spill out my insides

  B
asking questions
        C
that i never want to answer
         Gm
you will try
         Eb               B
to purge out this growing cancer

  B
youre there
      C
only when i realize
      Gm
until then
   Eb             B
i hide inside my own lies

        B
i will give up what kills me
      C
if i thought youd take it
    Gm
id give you my heart if 
   Eb               B
i knew you wouldnt break it

    B
my biggest fear
  C
if i let you in is
           Gm
that youll hurt me
Eb      B
like i hurt me

   B
or once you have access
      C
to my soul
  Eb                  Eb
will you take everything
    B
you want from me


 B
giving up
                C

          Eb            B
ive been practicing for you
