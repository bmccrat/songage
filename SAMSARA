          Bm
pretty in black
            A
kept out of sight
                 G
might never come back
               C
gonna put up a fight

          Bm
whats all forgotten
                    A
comes back from the past
                  G
what if you knew  dear
                  C
that this was the last

              Bm  
i found it in you
              A
and i see the same
              G
but im so far gone
                      C
dont even know my own name

       Bm
moving away
            A
into a dark night
           G
im keeping score
                C
in this winless fight

                  Bm
i have nowhere to go
            A
stuck in my soul
            G
testing the waters
                C
trapped in this hole-ole-ole

   Bm
ohhhh oh oh oh
      A
oh oh oh ohhhhh
    G
ohhhh oh oh oh 
      C
oh oh oh ohhhhh

     Bm
i am caught
            A
caught in a daze
              G
wondering how ill
                    C
make it out of this maze

     Bm
i am lost
                A
dont want to be found
           G
comforably numb
            C
dont make a sound

        Bm
door to door
          A
i sold my soul
           G
mind it is weak
                     C
as this vessel grows old

           Bm
scars only flesh
            A
mind always heals
             G
this body is weak
                C
despirte how it feels

            Bm
take a deep breath
          A
exhale my wounds
               G
we're becoming stars
             C
chasing that moooooooooooOOOON

Bm
ohhhh oh oh oh
      A
oh oh oh ohhhhh
    G
ohhhh oh oh oh 
      C
oh oh oh ohhhhh
