Je, Moi, Mon (Perspective)- 11/15/19 LIVE AT HZD
Composed and performed on mandolin primarily, played with plucky wide strums and palm muting during
the first verse, letting it ring only for the chorus.

we can walk in the woods for miles
          F                G
without a goddamn thing to say

never leave the house without a pen and paper she said
 Am            E          F       C
what good is a story that cant be read
Am                  E           F           C

the lessons in between the lines you know
  Am           E         F         C
