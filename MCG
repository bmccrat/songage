Composed on guitar fingerpicked and letting the chords ring

Dm
one funeral a month
       Em
is the quota
  Am
a ratio of suffering
       Em
two to one

Dm
gratitude for everytime
  Em
i shied away
      Am
from learning 
               Em
how to shoot a gun

         Dm
youll be cremated tomorrow
                Em
and ill be here thinking myself to death
                 Am
what is there to hold onto
              Em
when nothings left

        Dm
and the list gets longer and longer
       Em
of the things i wish i said
  Am
a penny for your thoughts
         Em
to every friend whose wound up dead

       Dm
and id like to remember
    Em
the image of your face
        Am
not the contorted mangled body
  Em  
i imagine in its place

    Dm
for everyone whose had to
                     Em
scrape their friends hearts up off the floors
    Am
and wash their grey matter
         Em
from the walls

   Dm
to everyone whose had to watch
Em
helplessly beside themselves
    Am
the rising
           Em
before the fallllll

   Dm
to good men lost
       Em
at the hands of themselves
   Am
to madness and
Em
salvaging grace

   Dm
to everyone with holes
Em    
blasted in their hearts
      Am
where nothing else can ever
          Em
fill that space


AND WE SANG...
Dm
AINT THAT THE LIFE
         Em
WE HAD A GOOD RUN
        Am
WE SANG SO LONG AND GOODNIGHT
                   Em
ILL SEE YOU IN THE NEXT ONE

AND WE SANG...
Dm
AINT THAT THE LIFE
         Em
WE HAD A GOOD RUN
        Am
WE SANG SO LONG AND GOODNIGHT
                   Em
ILL SEE YOU IN THE NEXT ONE
