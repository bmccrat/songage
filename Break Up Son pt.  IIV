           A
if i was a square 
                Em
i swear id be a newport
         G
and youd smoke me
                D
like youre from NY

that means youre gonna
       A
put me out
        G
halfway through

       A
cup of coffee 
                         Em
in one hand to fight the cold
        G
calling ma in the other
   A                   A
my dedication makes me wonder

   D
oh without you

wheres my motivation
       Em
to get out of bed!
   D
oh without you
            Em
who would i take a load off with
      C                   G
when theres existential dread

   D
oh without you

how would i make friends 
          Em
when i go out to bars
               C                             G
can i borrow a light man, i left mine in the car...

  A      
i said that i would quit you
  Em
a thousand times before
                G
like the time i died
                D
and you made my lungs sore

       A A A A
i told you
                 Em
that you were my last one
                  G
and that its been 10 years 
                    D
since you have me a buzz

            A
but then my stoop would miss me
   Em 
at 9 am
                    G               
and what would i be doing anyway

making my lover
A7 A7 A7 A7 
breakfast in bed or something?!?!


   D
oh without you

wheres my motivation
       Em
to get out of bed!
   D
oh without you
            Em
