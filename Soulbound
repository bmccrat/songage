Am
everyones so quick to change the subject
     C
when death introduces herself
              F         G
but when shes masked as life
           C
we let her stay

    Am  
the only way out is through you know
        C
and the more you hide
                       F
the less that god will care
     G           C
what you have to say

    F
the end has been rebirth
               G
since there was a beginning
          C
each fate pressed like pleats
          Am    G
in sunday bests

         F
fight it as we may
               G
love is a fine ramblin woman
        C
and ill follow her 
         F              G
till she settles in the west

           Am
minds that have no time for praying
           C
think that this all seems so real
         F
and what matters
       G                   C
can be bought and sold and kept

                 Am
but when my skin wrinkles like crepe paper
      C
and i cut my hair

to let it gray
  F              G          C
i refuse to look back on my regrets

   F
the end has been rebirth
               G
since there was a beginning
          C
each fate pressed like pleats
          Am    G
in sunday bests

         F
fight it as we may
               G
love is a fine ramblin woman
        C
and ill follow her 
         F              G
till she settles in the west
