Inside Outside (Self-hate, false pride)- 3/12/20
Written on guitar in typical country strumming with hammer ons from A TO A7 then to E

  A
i peel off dirty socks
          E
and dirty jeans
A
stretched to action
       E
living comfortable dreams

    A
the way i look on the outside
        E
is the way i want to see myself
    A
yet gazing at the mirrow
           E
im looking back at someone else

A
bring the body and the mind
     E
will follow they said
 A
take your time and 
E
time will make you better
                         A
than you ever could have thought
        E       
wake up love and you will see
     A
that pride cannot be borrowed
E
sold or bought

A
makeup smudges on 
E
watery eyes
  A
i think one day 
       E
my own lashes will be enough
  A
modified my outsides
        E
just to satisfy my insides
        A
i never cared at all
    E  
and now i care too much

A
one day who i appear to be
            E
will be the person that i am
    A
one day these shoes
            E
will have a foundation on which to stand.
